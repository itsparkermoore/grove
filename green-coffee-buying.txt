Green (unroasted) coffee buying should be modeled as a search problem, but it isn’t. It’s treated as a relationship-based procurement exercise with brand and origin reputation serving as proxies for future quality. In reality, year-to-year variation in cup score is driven by a non-stationary, multi-factor system with weak persistence. The quality-generating function is underdetermined and non-stationary, with far more latent variables than observable constraints, which produces stochastic and occasionally chaotic year-to-year outcomes. A corrected strategy runs on an explore-then-exploit loop. In the exploration phase, conduct a normalized random sampling across the global production space - normalizing for farm and mill count to avoid over-representing high density origins. In the exploitation phase, allocate sample roasting and cupping bandwidth to the high-signal clusters that emerge from this first pass. The net effect is that buyers cup less but discover more: instead of chasing historical reputation, they chase emergent quality. This reduces the required cupping hours, reduces the premium paid for expected quality, and increases the likelihood of finding undervalued coffees. The result is higher cup scores at lower cost.
